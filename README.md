# Tech Babes 
My personal brand and full-stack e-commerce platform celebrating women in tech with cute, empowering merchandise - designed and developed entirely by me.


## What It Is
Tech Babes is both a brand I created and the e-commerce platform I built to sell it. Every aspect is my own work:

🎨 Original designs - All merchandise graphics designed by me
💻 Full-stack development - Built the entire platform from scratch
🏢 Real business - Processing actual customer orders, not a demo project

The platform handles the complete purchase flow from browsing to automated order fulfillment via print-on-demand integration.
Key workflow:

Customer browses products and adds items to cart
Secure checkout powered by Stripe
Webhook listens for successful payment
Automated order creation sent to Printful for fulfillment
Customer receives order confirmation (coming soon: email notifications)

## The Creative Process
Beyond the code, I designed all the merchandise myself:

Created original graphics and illustrations in Canva
Developed brand identity (logo, color palette, voice)
Designed product mockups and photography layouts
Wrote all product descriptions and marketing

This isn't just a coding project. It's a full product I brought to life, from concept to customer.
